## Discovery of nano-materials(perovskite) for Green Hydrogen production application using machine learning models 

# Overview

### The time required by Nano Materials to enter the Manufacturing sector takes years as a consequence of continuous research and experimentation costs and facilities. With the growing industrial demands, the need for novel materials, with application-specific properties, is increasing rapidly. Considering computational material science techniques, the traditional DFT method is generally used but has a major disadvantage. It requires a large amount of computational power and time. By using Machine learning algorithms approach, eï¬ƒcient prediction of many properties of materials can be done, using only the much easily obtained elemental, structural or compositional information of materials.

# Goals

# Specifications

## Property predicted for the perovskites materials provided in the reference papers is regarding its stability and we are aiming to use the same data for the prediction of various different properties(ex. their ability to generate Hydrogen gas).

# Milestones
